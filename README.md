## Description
This application is a command-line interface (CLI) for managing and performing actions on different types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and motorbikes. It allows users to:

1. Create new vehicles (cars, trucks, and motorbikes) by providing details such as color, make, model, year, weight, top speed, and specific properties like towing capacity for trucks.

2. Select existing vehicles to perform various actions such as:
    - Printing vehicle details
    - Starting the vehicle
    - Accelerating or decelerating the vehicle
    - Stopping the vehicle
    - Turning the vehicle left or right
    - Reversing the vehicle
    - Selecting or creating another vehicle
    - Towing another vehicle (for trucks)
    - Performing a wheelie (for motorbikes)

3. Use the [inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to prompt the user for input and guide them through the available options and actions.
The application is structured with classes representing different vehicle types and a Cli class to handle user interactions and vehicle management.

## Installation
To install this application, follow these steps:
1. Clone [repository](https://github.com/Lauren245/Cars-and-Trucks)
2. Open code in a code editor such as VS Code.
3. Install dependencies by running the command *npm install* in the root directory using the integrated terminal.
4. Navigate to the src file in the integrated terminal and run the *npm start* command to run the application.

## Usage
- Upon startup, the CLI will prompt you to either create a new vehicle or select an existing vehicle.
    - If you choose to create a new vehicle, you will be asked to provide details such as color, make, model, year, weight, top speed, and specific properties like towing capacity for trucks.
    - If you choose to select an existing vehicle, you will be presented with a list of vehicles to choose from.

- After selecting or creating a vehicle, you can perform the following actions:
    - Print details 
    - Start vehicle
    - Accelerate 5 MPH
    - Decelerate 5 MPH
    - Stop vehicle
    - Turn right 
    - Turn left
    - Reverse
    - Tow a vehicle
    - Do a wheelie
    - Select or create another vehicle
    - Exit

- A truck is required for towing, and a motorbike is required for performing wheelies. If the user selects an option intended for a specific vehicle type that does not match their own vehicle type, they will be notified that the action cannot be performed.

- You can choose to exit the application at any time by selecting the *Exit* option from the actions list.

**Note: The actions list is too long to fit in the console without scrolling, making it appear as though the list regenerates. In reality, the selector simply can't return to the top.**

## Tests
Currently, there are no unit tests. There are test objects created for each type of vehicle in the index.ts file.
